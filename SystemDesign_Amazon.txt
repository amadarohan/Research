3. Component Diagram (Search Service)
This diagram focuses on the internal components of the Search Service container, illustrating how it handles a customer's product search query.

Description:

API Controller: The entry point for the Search Service. It receives a search query from the API Gateway.

Query Parser: A component that takes the raw query string and breaks it down, extracting keywords, filters (e.g., brand, price range), and sorting preferences.

Search Index Client: A component that queries the Search Index with the parsed query. It retrieves a list of matching product IDs and relevance scores.

Results Aggregator: A component that takes the product IDs from the search index and retrieves the full product details (e.g., name, price, image) from the Product Catalog Service. It may also add additional data from other services (e.g., inventory status).

Ranker: A component that re-ranks the aggregated results based on a machine learning model. This model can incorporate factors like popularity, recent sales, and personalized user history to provide more relevant results.

Response Formatter: A component that packages the final ranked results into a format suitable for the client application.

Architecture Decision Records
ADR 1: Use a Distributed Search Index for High-Performance Product Discovery
Status: Proposed

Context:
A key function of an e-commerce platform is enabling customers to find products quickly and accurately. The primary workload is a high volume of complex search queries (e.g., text search, filtering, sorting, relevance ranking) across a massive and constantly changing product catalog. A traditional database, even with indexing, would not be able to handle this workload with the required low latency.

Decision:
We will implement a dedicated, distributed Search Index (e.g., using Elasticsearch or Apache Solr) that is separate from the primary product database. The Product Catalog Service will be the single source of truth for product data, and any changes will be asynchronously streamed to the Search Index to keep it up-to-date. This index will be optimized for fast full-text search and complex filtering operations. When a user searches, the request will go directly to the Search Service, which queries the index for a fast response.

Consequences:

Positive:

High Performance: Queries are executed extremely fast, as the search index is optimized for search and filtering workloads, unlike a general-purpose database.

Scalability: The search index can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes, allowing the system to handle an ever-growing product catalog and query volume.

Rich Functionality: This architecture enables advanced search features like faceted search, type-ahead suggestions, and relevance ranking based on complex algorithms.

Negative:

Data Consistency: The product database and the search index are eventually consistent. There will be a slight delay between a product update in the database and its reflection in the search results. This is an acceptable trade-off for performance.

Increased Complexity: This adds a new distributed system to manage and monitor, including the data streaming pipeline to keep the index in sync.

Storage Redundancy: Product data is duplicated between the primary database and the search index, increasing storage costs.

Alternatives Considered:

Single Database with Search Functionality: Using a single relational database with full-text search features. While simpler to start with, this would become a major performance bottleneck as the product catalog and search traffic grow. It was rejected because it does not meet the scalability requirements for a large-scale e-commerce store.

In-House Search Engine: Building a custom search engine from scratch. This would offer maximum control and optimization but would be a massive, resource-intensive engineering effort with no clear benefit over a mature, purpose-built solution like Elasticsearch. It was rejected due to the immense development and maintenance cost.

ADR 2: Multi-Layered Caching Strategy for High-Read Data
Status: Proposed

Context:
An e-commerce store experiences extremely high read volumes, especially for product catalog browsing, popular product details, and personalized recommendations. Repeatedly fetching this data from primary databases and services for every customer request would lead to high latency, increased database load, and unnecessary costs. An effective caching strategy is crucial to deliver a low-latency user experience and scale the backend.

Decision:
We will implement a multi-layered caching strategy to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.

CDN (Content Delivery Network): For static assets (product images, CSS, JavaScript) and potentially highly cached, generic product listing pages (e.g., category pages without personalization), a global CDN will be used.

Edge/API Gateway Cache: A cache layer at the API Gateway (or a dedicated edge caching service) will store frequently accessed, generic API responses (e.g., popular product details, top-selling lists) that are not user-specific.

Distributed In-Memory Cache (e.g., Redis Cluster): A fast, distributed key-value store (Cache in the Container Diagram) will be extensively used across services for:

Product Catalog Service: Caching popular product details, category listings, and pricing.

User Service: Caching user profiles and authentication tokens.

Shopping Cart Service: Storing temporary cart contents for active user sessions (this could be its primary store or a cache for a more durable backend).

Recommendation Service: Caching pre-computed personalized recommendations.

Client-Side Caching: Web and mobile clients will implement their own local caching for recently viewed products and general UI data.

Cache Invalidation & TTL: A cache-aside pattern will be used. Data updates in primary databases will trigger asynchronous cache invalidation messages (e.g., via a message queue) or updates to the cache, ensuring cached data remains fresh. Time-to-live (TTL) will be applied to all cached entries based on data freshness requirements.

Consequences:

Positive:

Dramatic Performance Improvement: Significantly reduces latency for common read operations, resulting in a much faster and more responsive customer experience.

Reduced Database Load: Offloads a massive amount of read traffic from primary databases and backend services, allowing them to focus on write operations and reducing scaling pressure.

Increased System Throughput: The entire system can handle a much higher volume of requests due to faster data access from caches.

Cost Optimization: Fewer database calls can mean lower operational costs for database infrastructure.

Negative:

Cache Invalidation Complexity: Ensuring cached data remains fresh and invalidating stale entries correctly is a hard problem. Poorly managed invalidation can lead to customers seeing outdated information.

Data Consistency: Caches inherently introduce eventual consistency. There will be a brief window where cached data might not reflect the absolute latest state of the primary database.

Operational Overhead: Managing and monitoring distributed cache clusters (e.g., Redis) adds to the operational burden and requires specialized expertise.

Memory Consumption: Large, distributed caches require significant memory resources, which can be a notable cost factor.

Alternatives Considered:

No Caching: Every read request would hit the primary databases or services. This would be unacceptably slow and lead to severe bottlenecks during even moderate traffic, resulting in a poor user experience and high infrastructure costs. Rejected for fundamental performance and scalability limitations.

Single-Layer Cache Only: Relying on just one layer of caching (e.g., only a distributed in-memory cache). While helpful, this wouldn't provide the optimal performance benefits of a multi-layered approach that leverages CDNs for static content and client-side caches for personalized local data. Rejected for sub-optimal performance.

Write-Through/Write-Back Caching: These patterns involve writing data directly to the cache and then asynchronously to the database (write-back) or synchronously to both (write-through). While offering strong consistency for writes and lower write latency for the application, they add complexity to cache logic and are often overkill for read-heavy scenarios with simpler data models. Cache-aside with explicit invalidation is generally preferred for its simplicity and effectiveness in read-heavy e-commerce systems.

ADR 3: Real-time Recommendation Engine Architecture
Status: Proposed

Context:
Personalized product recommendations are critical for driving sales and improving the customer experience in an e-commerce store like Amazon. The Recommendation Service must be able to generate relevant suggestions based on a user's browsing history, purchase patterns, item popularity, and other factors, and deliver these recommendations with low latency on product pages, homepages, and in the shopping cart. The challenge is to process massive amounts of data for training and serve predictions in real-time.

Decision:
We will implement a hybrid recommendation engine architecture combining offline batch processing for model training and candidate generation with online real-time processing for personalization and serving.

Offline Training Pipeline: A batch processing pipeline (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop) will periodically (e.g., daily) analyze historical user behavior data (views, clicks, purchases), product attributes, and social signals. This pipeline will train machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering, deep learning models) and generate broad item-to-item or user-to-item recommendations. These pre-computed recommendations will be stored in a specialized, fast-access database or indexed in a distributed cache.

Real-time Feature Engineering & Scoring: When a user requests recommendations, the Recommendation Service will:

Fetch pre-computed candidates from the offline-generated data.

In real-time, gather fresh context about the user (e.g., current browsing session, items in cart) and the product they are viewing.

Use lightweight, online machine learning models to re-rank or filter candidates based on this real-time context.

Serving: The final, personalized recommendations will be served with low latency, potentially from a dedicated in-memory cache (part of the Cache in the Container Diagram) for frequently requested user/product combinations.

Consequences:

Positive:

Highly Relevant Recommendations: Combining offline and online signals allows for both comprehensive, broad recommendations and dynamic, real-time personalization.

Scalability: Offline training can handle massive datasets, while online serving is optimized for low-latency inference. Both components can scale independently.

Improved User Experience & Sales: Tailored recommendations significantly enhance product discoverability and drive higher conversion rates.

Flexibility: Easily adaptable to new recommendation algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

Negative:

High Complexity: Designing, building, and maintaining a hybrid ML-driven recommendation system (data pipelines, model training, online serving, A/B testing) is one of the most complex components of an e-commerce store.

Computational Cost: Offline model training requires significant compute resources (GPUs, specialized clusters).

Data Latency & Freshness: Ensuring that the online models have access to fresh user context and product data in real-time is challenging.

Cold Start Problem: Providing recommendations for new users or new products is difficult until sufficient interaction data is collected. Specialized algorithms are needed to address this.

Explainability & Bias: ML models can be "black boxes," making it hard to explain why a particular recommendation was made or to detect and mitigate algorithmic biases.

Alternatives Considered:

Pure Offline Batch Recommendations: Pre-compute all recommendations daily. While simpler, this would lead to stale recommendations that don't react to a user's current session or trending products, resulting in lower relevance. Rejected for lack of real-time personalization.

Pure Real-time/Session-Based Recommendations: Only generate recommendations based on the current user session (e.g., "users who viewed this also viewed..."). This is fast but lacks the depth and broadness of recommendations derived from comprehensive historical data. Rejected for limited scope and less relevant results for new users.

Simple Rule-Based Recommendations: Using handcrafted rules (e.g., "show top-selling products in category X"). This is easy to implement but provides very generic recommendations and does not scale well or adapt to user preferences. Rejected for low relevance and limited adaptability.

ADR 4: Real-time Inventory Management with Distributed Locking
Status: Proposed

Context:
Accurate and real-time inventory management is critical for an e-commerce store. Overselling (selling more items than are in stock) leads to customer dissatisfaction, order cancellations, and operational headaches. Under-selling (not making available items that are in stock) leads to lost revenue. The Inventory Service must handle a high volume of concurrent "check stock" and "reserve stock" operations, especially during peak sales.

Decision:
We will implement real-time inventory management using a combination of a highly concurrent database and distributed locking/optimistic concurrency control.

Dedicated Inventory Service & DB: The Inventory Service will be an independent microservice with its own dedicated, high-performance database (e.g., a sharded relational database like CockroachDB for strong consistency and horizontal scalability, or a key-value store like Redis for very fast temporary reservations).

Atomic Stock Updates: When a customer places an item in their cart or proceeds to checkout, the Order Service will send a ReserveStockCommand to the Inventory Service. The Inventory Service will use database-level transactions with row-level locking or optimistic locking (version numbers) to atomically decrement the available stock for that product.

Distributed Lock (for high contention): For extremely high-demand products where many users might be attempting to purchase the last few items concurrently, a distributed lock manager (e.g., ZooKeeper, Consul, or Redis-based locks) could be employed at the Inventory Service to serialize critical stock updates, preventing race conditions and ensuring no overselling. This is a targeted optimization for rare, high-contention scenarios.

Asynchronous Release: If an order is canceled or a cart expires, an asynchronous event will trigger the Inventory Service to release reserved stock.

Consequences:

Positive:

Prevents Overselling: Atomic updates and distributed locking mechanisms ensure that the system accurately reflects available stock, preventing overselling and its associated customer dissatisfaction.

High Accuracy: Provides real-time and highly accurate stock levels for customers.

High Concurrency: The chosen database and locking strategies are designed to handle a large number of concurrent stock queries and updates.

Scalability: The Inventory Service and its database can be scaled horizontally, especially if sharding is employed.

Negative:

Increased Complexity: Implementing distributed locking and managing optimistic concurrency adds significant complexity to the Inventory Service.

Performance Overhead (Locking): Distributed locks introduce a small amount of latency and contention. Careful design is needed to minimize their impact on overall throughput.

Deadlocks: Incorrect implementation of distributed locks can lead to deadlocks, freezing parts of the system.

Eventual Consistency (for display): While the inventory reservation is strongly consistent, the display of stock to customers might be eventually consistent due to caching (ADR 2) or network delays.

Database Choice: Requires a database that supports strong consistency and highly concurrent write operations.

Alternatives Considered:

Simple SQL UPDATE without Locking: Using a basic UPDATE SET stock = stock - N WHERE product_id = X AND stock >= N without explicit locking. While often sufficient for low-concurrency, this is vulnerable to race conditions and overselling under high concurrent load. Rejected for lack of robustness at scale.

Inventory as Event Log: Treating inventory as an immutable event log (e.g., using event sourcing), where stock is determined by aggregating "stock added" and "stock reserved" events. While highly scalable for writes, querying current stock in real-time is complex, often requiring read models or materialized views, and it doesn't solve the immediate problem of preventing concurrent double-reservations without strong consistency at the read model. Rejected for query complexity and difficulty in preventing overselling in real-time.

Cache-Only Inventory: Storing inventory solely in a fast cache (e.g., Redis) and pushing updates to a database asynchronously. While fast, this risks data loss if the cache fails before persistence and lacks the strong consistency guarantees needed for financial inventory. Rejected for lack of durability and strong consistency.
