System Design for: 'Stock Exchange System'

This document outlines the architectural design for a scalable and high-performance Stock Exchange system. The design prioritizes low-latency trade execution, high availability, and the integrity of financial transactions. It is a distributed system to handle the massive volume of real-time market data and a high-frequency of orders.

### C4 Model Diagrams

#### 1\. System Context Diagram

The System Context diagram provides a high-level view of the Stock Exchange system and its interactions with external users and systems. It shows the core exchange interacting with traders, brokerage firms, and financial news services.

**Description:**

  * **Trader:** A person who submits buy and sell orders to the exchange. They can be individual investors or institutional traders.
  * **Brokerage Firm:** An institutional client that provides access to the exchange for its users and manages their accounts. It is the primary way most traders interact with the exchange.
  * **Financial News Service:** An external system that consumes real-time market data (e.g., stock prices, trading volumes) from the exchange to provide news and analysis.
  * **Stock Exchange (System in Scope):** The central system that facilitates the trading of financial instruments, matches orders, and disseminates market data.

    Rel(stock_exchange, financial_news, "Disseminates real-time market data to")
```

#### 2\. Container Diagram

This diagram zooms into the Stock Exchange system, showing the major containers. The design is a distributed system with specialized components for different aspects of trading.

**Description:**

  * **Order Management System (OMS):** The entry point for all incoming orders. It validates orders, manages their lifecycle (e.g., open, filled, canceled), and routes them to the Matching Engine.
  * **Market Data Publisher:** A high-throughput component that broadcasts real-time market data, such as the best bid and ask prices, and trade executions, to subscribers.
  * **Matching Engine:** The core of the exchange. It is an extremely low-latency, in-memory component that matches buy and sell orders to execute trades. It uses a specialized data structure like a limit order book.
  * **Risk Management Service:** A component that performs real-time checks on orders to ensure they comply with risk limits and regulations. It can reject orders that exceed these limits.
  * **Clearing and Settlement Service:** A post-trade component that finalizes transactions, ensuring that funds and securities are transferred correctly between accounts. It communicates with external banking and depository systems.
  * **Historical Data Store:** A database optimized for storing large volumes of historical trade data for auditing, backtesting, and reporting purposes.
  * **Order Book (Data Store):** The primary in-memory data store for the Matching Engine. It holds all active limit orders for a financial instrument.
  * **Streaming Data Platform:** A distributed message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka) used for broadcasting market data and managing the flow of orders between services.

#### 3\. Component Diagram (Matching Engine)

This diagram focuses on the internal components of the **Matching Engine** container, illustrating how it processes an order and matches it against the order book.

**Description:**

  * **Order Ingestion Component:** The entry point for the Matching Engine. It receives orders from the Streaming Data Platform.
  * **Order Book Manager:** The core logic that manages the limit order book data structure. It adds new orders to the book and removes filled or canceled orders.
  * **Matching Algorithm:** A critical component that implements the matching logic. It checks for a match between the incoming order and existing orders in the book (e.g., a buy order at a price equal to or higher than a sell order's price).
  * **Trade Execution Publisher:** A high-speed component that publishes details of executed trades to a message queue for other services (e.g., Market Data Publisher, Historical Data Store, and Clearing Service).

### Architecture Decision Record

#### ADR 1: Use an In-Memory Matching Engine for Ultra-Low Latency

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**
In a stock exchange system, the time it takes to match a buy order with a sell order is a critical performance metric. High-frequency trading and algorithmic trading demand latency measured in microseconds, not milliseconds. Using a traditional disk-based database for the order book would introduce unacceptable I/O latency, making the system non-competitive. The core function of the exchange—the order matching—must be as fast as physically possible.

**Decision:**
The core **Matching Engine** will be an in-memory application. All active orders will be stored in a specialized, volatile data structure (e.g., a hash map or a tree) in the server's RAM. The entire matching process—receiving an order, looking up a match, and executing the trade—will occur in memory to eliminate disk I/O latency. Persistence will be handled asynchronously by a separate, high-performance logging or replication service to a disk-based data store.

**Consequences:**

  * **Positive:**

      * **Ultra-Low Latency:** This design provides the lowest possible latency for trade execution, which is crucial for a competitive exchange.
      * **High Throughput:** By avoiding disk I/O, the system can process a very large number of orders per second, handling high-frequency trading volumes.
      * **Simplicity of Logic:** The in-memory data structure is simpler to manage and access than a complex, distributed database, allowing the core matching logic to be highly optimized.

  * **Negative:**

      * **Data Volatility:** Since the primary order book is in memory, a system crash or power failure would result in the loss of all active orders. This requires a robust and highly reliable asynchronous persistence mechanism (e.g., using a write-ahead log) and a fast recovery process to restore the order book from disk.
      * **Memory Footprint:** The entire order book must fit into the server's RAM. While this is feasible for a single instrument, it requires significant memory capacity for an exchange that trades thousands of different instruments. This can be mitigated by sharding the order book by instrument.
      * **Complexity of Asynchronous Persistence:** Ensuring that the in-memory state is consistently and correctly replicated to disk without introducing blocking operations is a complex engineering challenge.

**Alternatives Considered:**

  * **Disk-Based Database:** Using a traditional relational or NoSQL database for the order book. This would provide strong durability out-of-the-box but would introduce unacceptable latency for order matching, making the system unsuitable for modern trading.
  * **Distributed Database with In-Memory Caching:** Using a distributed database with a large cache layer. While this is a common pattern for high-performance systems, the latency introduced by network calls between the application and the database/cache, even for in-memory databases, is higher than a purely in-memory solution where data and logic are co-located in the same process. It was rejected because the primary requirement of a stock exchange is absolute minimal latency.
