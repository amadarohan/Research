System Design for: 'Uber'

This document outlines the architectural design for a scalable ride-sharing service like Uber. The system is designed to handle a massive number of real-time events, match riders with drivers efficiently, manage a high volume of transactions, and provide real-time location tracking, all with a focus on low-latency and high availability.

### C4 Model Diagrams

#### 1\. System Context Diagram

The System Context diagram provides a high-level view of the Uber system and its interactions with external users and systems. It shows the core platform interacting with riders, drivers, and third-party services for payments, maps, and SMS.

**Description:**

  * **Rider:** A person who requests a ride using the Uber mobile app.
  * **Driver:** A person who accepts ride requests and provides transportation.
  * **Uber System (System in Scope):** The central platform that facilitates the matching of riders and drivers, manages rides, and handles payments.
  * **Third-Party Payment Gateway:** An external service that securely processes credit card payments.
  * **Third-Party Map Service:** An external system (e.g., Google Maps) that provides mapping, geocoding, and routing services.
  * **SMS Gateway:** An external service that sends SMS notifications to users.

#### 2\. Container Diagram

This diagram zooms into the Uber system, showing the major independently deployable components. The design is based on a microservices architecture to handle the real-time, event-driven nature of the service.

**Description:**

  * **Mobile/Web Client:** The application (iOS, Android, or web) that riders and drivers interact with. It communicates with the API Gateway.
  * **API Gateway:** The single entry point for all client requests. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
  * **User Service:** A microservice that manages user profiles (riders and drivers), authentication, and account data.
  * **Trip Service:** The core microservice that manages the lifecycle of a ride (request, matching, in-progress, completion, cancellation).
  * **Location Service:** A high-throughput, real-time service that tracks the live GPS location of all drivers. This is a critical and highly scalable component.
  * **Matching Service:** A specialized service that takes a rider's request and matches it with the most suitable nearby driver. This service uses a sophisticated ranking algorithm.
  * **Payment Service:** A microservice that handles all payment-related logic and communicates with the third-party Payment Gateway.
  * **Notification Service:** A microservice that sends real-time notifications to riders and drivers via SMS or push notifications.
  * **Geospatial Database:** A specialized data store optimized for storing and querying geographical data (e.g., driver locations). It needs to handle a very high volume of updates.
  * **Ride Store (Database):** A relational or document database that stores trip history, status, and details.

#### 3\. Component Diagram (Matching Service)

This diagram focuses on the internal components of the **Matching Service** container, illustrating how it matches a rider with a driver.

**Description:**

  * **API Controller:** The entry point for the Matching Service. It receives a ride request from the Trip Service.
  * **Geospatial Query Engine:** A component that queries the Geospatial Database to find all available drivers within a certain radius of the rider's location.
  * **Driver Ranker:** A component that scores the potential drivers based on a variety of factors, such as distance, estimated time of arrival (ETA), driver rating, and current surge pricing.
  * **Matching Algorithm:** The core logic that selects the single best-fit driver from the ranked list. It may use different strategies (e.g., closest driver, highest-rated driver).
  * **Dispatch Service Client:** A component that sends the final match result back to the Trip Service for dispatching the ride request to the selected driver.

### Architecture Decision Record

#### ADR 1: Use a Geospatial Database for Real-time Location Tracking and Matching

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**
The Uber system's core functionality relies on the ability to perform high-frequency location updates and ultra-low-latency spatial queries. A traditional relational database is not optimized for this type of workload. Storing and querying millions of real-time geospatial coordinates efficiently requires a specialized data store that can handle rapid read and write operations for location data.

**Decision:**
We will use a specialized **Geospatial Database** for tracking the real-time locations of drivers. This database will be designed to handle a high volume of writes (driver location updates) and low-latency spatial queries (e.g., finding all drivers within a specific radius of a rider). Options like Redis with Geospatial capabilities or a distributed key-value store like Cassandra with a custom geospatial index would be considered. This database will be separate from the main Ride Store to decouple the high-throughput location tracking from the rest of the system's transactional data.

**Consequences:**

  * **Positive:**

      * **Performance:** Provides extremely fast lookups for nearby drivers, which is critical for a low-latency matching process.
      * **Scalability:** The system can handle a massive number of concurrent driver location updates without affecting the performance of other services.
      * **Simplicity of Queries:** Geospatial queries are handled natively by the database, simplifying the application logic.

  * **Negative:**

      * **Data Consistency:** The real-time location data is volatile and can be eventually consistent. This is an acceptable trade-off as immediate accuracy is more important than transactional consistency for driver locations.
      * **Operational Complexity:** Managing and scaling a specialized, distributed geospatial database requires specific expertise and adds to the system's operational overhead.
      * **Memory/Storage Requirements:** Storing and indexing a large number of live locations can consume a significant amount of memory, depending on the chosen technology.

**Alternatives Considered:**

  * **Relational Database with Spatial Extensions:** Using a relational database like PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension. While this provides excellent geospatial functionality, it may struggle with the sheer volume of real-time writes required for a large-scale system like Uber. It was rejected due to potential write bottlenecks.
  * **Flat File System:** Storing locations in a distributed file system. While this can handle a high volume of writes, performing real-time spatial queries would be computationally expensive and slow, making it unsuitable for the real-time matching requirement. It was rejected because it would not meet the low-latency read requirements.
